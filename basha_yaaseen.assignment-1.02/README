Assignment 1.02 - Moving from map to map

For this assignment, I followed the suggestions from the Prof of having a struct in a header file as well as a map generation file and a world generation file. I have met all the requirements, but I will discuss some things that will ease the grading/testing of this code. I will list my borders(the 4 corners of the world) externally and then internally as well. The top left corner is (-200, -200) externally and (0,0) internally. The top right corner is (200, -200) externally and (400, 0) internally since going north is y-1. The bottom left corner is (-200, 200) externally and (0, 400) internally since going south is y+1. The bottom right corner is (200, 200) externally and (400, 400) internally.

If a user goes beyond the border by either going 'n', 'e', 's', 'w' to a place they can't go, I display an error message and let them choose again. However, if user tries to fly to a location they cant go to (beyond the world) I display the map and promptly break as that is what made sense to me. The way I have my corners and my world set up is peculiar at first, but it is consistent throughout the project and fulfills all the given requirements including the chances of pokemarts and pokecenters being spawned. I followed the formula for the probability that the Prof gave and implemented the logic of not placing the building(s) if the probability isnt greater than the random number that I generate.

The maps are all random with the exception of going to an already visited map and the exits of maps that have any of their adjacent maps generated. The exits match up if they need to be. In essence, I fulfill all the requirements.
