This is my submission for assignment 1.06. All the features specified in the 
assignment spec works. Here are a couple of things to take note however:
-I took the functionality of going through exits diagonally. I just didnt want that functionality in the game as it just doesnt make
   sense to have that functionality. Instead, only way pc can go through exits is going straight through it by going directly left, right, up or down on an exit.
-For my implementation for fly, you click f. Then as I state on the terminal, you enter two ints with a space in between each int and pressing enter after the second enter.
     Then you "fly" to that map.

IMPORTANT NOTE: For some really annoying reason, my ncurses freezes. This doesnt happen everytime but it can happen. IF it does, the screen like freezes and no input works.
	  You cant even quit the program unless you exit out of pyrite entirely. Ive tried hours and hours trying to figure out why to no avail. If you have an idea as to why, Id love
	  to hear it! Hopefully it doesnt happen tho. Like you dont experience this gut-wrenching bug. If it does, try closing, doing a make clean, and trying again. Thanks!

That is all, thanks!
