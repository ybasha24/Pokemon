This is my program for the random terrain generation. My approach was to first generate a random path. I did this by generating random exit points along each of the borders and then generating a path from N-S and W-E. I then inserted my pokemart and pokecenter as well. Then, I generated the terrain from each quadrant using a similar recursive function as the sandpile program from the previous assignment. I randomly assigned quadrant 1 or 2 to be tall grass and the other to be clearings. I did the same thing for quadrant 3 and 4. I then randomly sprinkled in some trees. The requirements of having 2 regions of tall grass and 2 regions of clearings as well as having a pokecenter and pokemart are met. I do not add any other boulders or mountains other than what is already included but as I mentioned, I do sprinkle in some trees. Not including more boulders/mountains is not a bug as it is not a requirement. All the actual requiremnets for this assignment has been met. Not the best way to go about randomly generating a map but it does the job, thanks :)
UPDATE: I sprinkled in some boulders at random locations so the map has all the requirements as well as all terrains :)
