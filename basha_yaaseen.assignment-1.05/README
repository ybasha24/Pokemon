This is my submission for assignment 1.05. All the features specified in the 
assignment spec works. Here are a couple of things to take note however:
-When clicking t to get the trainer list, I output a new window with all the trainers.
  This means there is no need to scroll up and down the list of trainers since they all fit the screen
  since I have commented out the ability to add whatever number of trainers you want for now.
-I have commented the code out for --numtrainers switch. Decided to comment it out so it would be easier for 
  me to work on this assignment and work on the functionality of movement and whatnot.
-Everything else works as expected including entering pokemart and pokecenter and battling trainers. To exit 
  the placeholder for the battle interface, simply press escape key. 
-After defeating a hiker or rival, I basically have them as a sentry with the defeated hiker and rival no 
  longer moving. 
-To quit the game, just type q

That is all, thanks!
