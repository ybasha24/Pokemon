This is my submission for assignment 1.07. All the features specified in the 
assignment spec works. Here are a few things to keep note:
- To parse a specific file, a command line argument is needed. For example, to parse the pokemon.csv file, then this must be run: ./assignment7 pokemon
  This is for all the files that you want to parse.
- If one of the cells is empty I initialize that cell to INT_MAX and print the empty cell as well, as was expected.

Everything else works as expected. I successfully parse any of the 9 files and put them in their respective structs. I then print out the contents of the specific struct!


That is all, thanks!
