This is my submission for 1.04. I have implenented another priority queue which is very similar to the one I made last week for dijkstras except now it holds characters. I also implemented several methods for the logic of the character movement. Everything seems to be working correctly. I added the functionality of numtrainers argument so user can input the amount of trainers. If an error occurs, ctrl c and do it again although I havent run into some errors (yet). Otherwise, everything else should work as expected and required. Thanks!
